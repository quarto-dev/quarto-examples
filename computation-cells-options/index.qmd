<!-- below is the example itself -->

```{css}
/*| echo: false */
h2 {
  color: blue;
}
```

## This will be blue

In this document we have added the following `css` chunk known by the **knitr** engine

```{{css}}
/*| echo: false */
h2 {
  color: blue;
}
```

By default, it is `echo: true` but we can pass some chunk option by using the language comment syntax (`/*` and `*/` here for CSS), appending pipe character `|` after start comment. 
This is how we set the configuration to be `echo: false` and not show the content in the output document.

Quarto is aware about comments character(s) for a number of language.
