# How to Draw a Violin Plot of the Iris Data Using Seaborn

## Overview

Seaborn is a powerful Python visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. One of its features is the ability to easily create violin plots, which are excellent for visualizing the distribution and density of data. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to create a violin plot using the Seaborn library with the Iris dataset.

## Code Implementation

Follow these simple steps to draw a violin plot using Seaborn:

### Step-by-Step Code

Below is a complete example to create a violin plot for the Iris dataset using Seaborn:

```{python}
from quarto import theme_brand_seaborn

light_params = theme_brand_seaborn("light-brand.yml")
dark_params = theme_brand_seaborn("dark-brand.yml")
```


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| renderings: [light, dark]
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the iris dataset
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

# Set up the matplotlib figure
sns.set_theme(rc = light_params)
g = sns.violinplot(x="species", y="sepal_length", data=iris, inner="quartile")
g.set(title="Violin plot of Sepal Length by Species")
plt.title("Hello")
plt.show(block=False)

# note, must set new theme before starting new figure
# otherwise axis area will be wrong color
sns.set_theme(rc = dark_params)
plt.figure()
g = sns.violinplot(x="species", y="sepal_length", data=iris, inner="quartile")
g.set(title="Violin plot of Sepal Length by Species")
plt.title("Hello")
plt.show(block=False)
```

### Explanation

1. **Data Loading**: We use Seaborn's `load_dataset` function to load the Iris dataset, which is included in Seaborn's collection of sample datasets.
2. **Creating the Violin Plot**: The `violinplot` function from Seaborn is used, where we specify the `x` parameter to be the species and the `y` parameter to be the sepal length. The `inner="quartile"` option adds a box plot inside the violin plot to display the quartiles of the data, providing additional context.
3. **Display Settings**: The plot's title is set for clarity, and the plot is displayed using `plt.show()`, which renders the complete visualization.

### Additional Note

Seaborn simplifies the process of creating violin plots significantly compared to manual methods with other libraries like Bokeh. It is especially useful for visualizations that require presenting the distribution alongside comparison groups without extensive configuration.
